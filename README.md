# The-control-code-and-GUI-for-multimodality-imaging-system
This repo is an implementation of the control code and GUI of the multimodality imaging system in paper:

https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/abstract.cfm?uri=boe-11-7-3659.

This repo includes the connection and control functions necessary to set imaging scanning parameters, data acquisition and imaging post processing.

With the help of this MATLAB-based package, you can achieve Optical coherence tomography (OCT),photoacoustic microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and laser emission spectra collection for your specific imaging application.

Below is some example figures, in which we achieve single cell tracking in living animal's eyes with OCT,
